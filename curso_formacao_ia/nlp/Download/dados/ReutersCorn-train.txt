"GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen Jesse Helms (R NC), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the programs impact on the USDA loan program If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said But a negative report on certificates will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program, an agricultural consultant said The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it  Reuter  ",0

"OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES   ANALYSTS OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems, said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets OPECs problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way, said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc He said the markets earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 158 mln bpd quota set last December OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials, said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again, he added David T Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens, Mizrahi said But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 158 mln bpd Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPECs ability to hold together prices and output OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then, said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York But Bijan Moussavar Rahmani of Harvard Universitys Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 158 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production, he told Reuters in a telephone interview  Reuter  ",0

"SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS Switzerlands economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 175 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 125 pct after last years sharp fall to 075 pct from 36 pct in 1985 But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24 industrial nation OECD area Assuming an average exchange rate of 171 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 169 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 275 pct rise in exports and a 35 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 325 pct and 65 pct respectively in 1986 The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years But given Switzerlands large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances, the OECD said Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 325 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 225 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986 But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange The long term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said Particularly for the banks, recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required   To preserve its competitive position, it said  REUTER  ",0

"FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil The weekly US soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 2178 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick up in the weekly crush number However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months US processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 13970 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds), one CBT crush trader said But theyve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month, he added As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 226 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down time, so far But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added  Reuter  ",0

"FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE US MONETARY POLICY Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed, said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Feds policy has been unchanged up to today Although Volckers statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in todays data, which covered the two week bank statement period ended yesterday This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Feds decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added Todays data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 39 billion dlrs, economists said The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday, said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago But there was a clearly justified need for them There was nothing ominous The Fed couldnt have waited until the start of the new statement period today If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections, added Security Pacifics Bannon A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher than  expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Feds discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists forecasts of about 200 mln For the two week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings, said Scott Winningham of JS Winningham and Co The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6 1 8 pct, said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp I expect it to continue in that vein Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs, added First Chicagos Johnson Banks excess reserves averaged 103 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 150 billion in the previous one After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M 1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper than anticipated 21 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16 Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollars progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollars effect on Fed policy, said First Chicagos Johnson Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it wont pull back from easing  Reuter  ",0
"FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES Frances right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 25 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 28 per cent from a 28 per cent target written into the annual budget last september Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget cutting rigour and pay restraint But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988 The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago, said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year The big question is whether the governments policy of wage moderation will be maintained, he added The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 17 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices Calling the governments policies unbalanced and unjust, he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist led CGT, the largest of Frances unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that, commented Michel Develle, economist at recently privatised Banque Paribas Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 26 or 27 per cent this year against last years 21 per cent But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed, he commented Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 09 per cent surge in January living costs But they claimed it was a once off phenomenon that should have no knock on impact on the rest of the year Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control Prices could rise 15 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE,  Marais said But the second half year should be better, he added Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said  Reuter  ",0

"AUSTRALIAS KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986 87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 225 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 075 percentage points to non farm gdp growth of 25 pct while net exports would account for 175 points Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986 87 of 1475 billion    our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion, he said Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986 87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time, he said On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986 87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane, he said Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987 88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987 88, Keating said As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987 88, he said  REUTER  ",0

"GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind,  Gulf International Bank BSC  (GIB) said The banks economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts, he said The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories    money markets, stock and bond markets Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind, he said Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states    Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia But he added there is no bond market to speak of in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978 While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said  REUTER  ",0

"FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said With gross domestic product likely to grow only 21 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 115 pct of the workforce by mid 1988, from its present 109 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy The report said the French economy was increasingly ill adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets Frances poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average  And A substantial loss of market share In the past 18 months, it said Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 29 billion dlrs this year from 24 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly, it added But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 09 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the governments deregulation of service sector tariffs We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost, one OECD official commented OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 25 or three pct The government last week revised its forecast up to between 24 and 25 pct from two pct, against last years 21 pct But the OECD backed the governments view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last years fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue, it said  REUTER  ",0

"SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said Prospects for another near record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year), Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for EHutton said The next six weeks in the USSRs grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us, an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops    sometimes as much as 30 35 pct lower Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination Fall dryness may be a problem Theres a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness, Martell said Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused  problems of ice crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off pasture feeding, they said The Soviets are not in a desperate situation   they dont have to buy (grains) now, a USDA official said But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last years huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half, Martell said  Reuter  ",0

"COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4 1 2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close The New York May price was down 1559 at 10800 cents a lb Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said The ICO 15 day average price stood at 11466 cents a lb for March 2 This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried, Dauster said, adding now it is time to go and sell coffee But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said It is too difficult to forecast now Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 112 mln Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on Londons futures market last year A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas Consumers said objective criteria like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate policy to other producers While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve different share outs of quota, Dauster said Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage, one delegate said Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine In that case quotas could come into force during the summer But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazils Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980 A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability In contrast producers wanted stop gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now, one consumer said  Reuter  ",0

"FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for US banks that takes into account the riskiness of a banks loans and other assets Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England The Fed set a 60 day period for public comment on the plan The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments Previously, the Fed Jan 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off balance sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a banks minimum capital needs The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a banks current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure The current exposure would be measured by the mark to market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and US banking regulators Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of US banks to compete in world financial markets However, the staff concluded, The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20 25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the UK US effort to draft new capital rules  Reuter  ",0

"EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE The 350 mln Ecu three year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said The ministers agreed that under this extensification scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops At present such allowances are available only for livestock The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay early retirement pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed  Reuter  ",0
"US, BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the US And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure    on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of US And UK Banking organisations to price Contracts competitively  At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so called credit equivalent amount   the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights The only guarantees recognised are those given by US And UK Governments or, in the US, By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges It said US Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to net contracts    consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream It recognised that such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation, and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges It said US Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to net contracts    consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream It recognised that such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation, and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account  Reuter  ",0

"COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING US Failure of talks on re establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the US is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by objective criteria, US officials said Jon Rosenbaum, assistant US trade representative and head of Washingtons delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary Rosenbaum said the United States will be flexible in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the US, proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producers recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the worlds largest producer Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the US customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but nobody is proposing we change our position However, other US government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers, said one US official The US official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the US State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the US position, US officials said The State department, a major player in setting US coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically sensitive US allies in Central America, US officials said El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, US officials said Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions In London, the US was supported by the UK, the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, US officials said This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals However, US sources said West Germanys support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the US to block producer plans While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, US officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazils position US officials blamed Brazils intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement  Reuter  ",0

"TURKEY SEES 15 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986 Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 15 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 51 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 246 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year This years target of 20 pct might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful, he said Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the governments economic planning, said Turkeys creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years, he added His comment echoed last Octobers Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankaras case for more medium term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit, he said Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations, he said It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 56 pct in 1986 More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned, Tigrel said He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible  REUTER  ",0
"ENERGY CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last years sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985s levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said Companies will probably only drill their best prospects, said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc Few new wells now are being drilled Only 33 rigs, about one quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity Its in the dregs right now, said Bolster of the states drilling activity Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell Prices for Californias marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs More than half of Californias oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said Its not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs, Malmgreen said Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said In the heart of Californias oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two thirds of the states oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled I dont think theyll even get to what they did last year, Mitchell said No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission In line with that decrease, Californias crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said Between February and October 1986, Californias crude oil production slipped from an all time high of 1185 mln barrels per day to 1066 mln bpd, Guerard said Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels, Guerard said  Reuter  ",0

"TALKING POINT GENERAL MOTORS  GM  General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GMs future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share GM shares rose 3 1 2 to 79 1 8 in active trading Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they  differed sharply over the carmakers long term prospects Im very positive on GM, said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co Theyre clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990 The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 32 mln shares changing hands by mid day The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive The buyback doesnt really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet, he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 550 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 821 dlrs Healys numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 780 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 1080 dlrs in 1988 Like other analysts, Healy sees GMs share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987 On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors, he said In late February, GM car sales fell 86 pct from the year ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co  F  and Chrysler Corp  C  both posted increases But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months Overall, GMs share of US car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said The numbers include imports Kidder Peabodys Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now its rolling up its sleeves and getting serious I think theres a major earnings surprise in the winds, he said Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 565 dlrs this year and 975 dlrs in 1988 The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler, he said Another positive for the stock is GMs dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said US car sales will weaken, and GMs new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share, which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988 Im not looking for improvement this year This is a transition year for GM, he said Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 780 dlrs and 1988 at 1080 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results But the key thing isnt so much what they earn this year Its the momentum beyond this year thats important  Reuter  ",0

"NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY US and UK bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding Kenneth McCormick, co chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals What they are proposing is really double counting, Patrick de Saint Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value    say one pct per year to maturity    or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected, said a director at one UK merchant bank What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now    to borrow money now    to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now, he added(Adds title first paragraph) Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the UK US effort to draft new capital rules  Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other The paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design  One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market So we dont know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court, said one bank official  Reuter  ",0

"NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG US, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the yens sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G 5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan US Trade axis into a Japan  European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza, he said On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242 Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G 5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US, against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them Suddenly, instead of the US, It is Europe that is laying the golden egg, said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge, said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry If you want my objective view, I dont expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again, he said  REUTER  ",0

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT   POLISH SANCTIONS Poland says US Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses Some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms, one banking source said But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Polands economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under  achieving They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems, one said The US Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the US In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 16 billion, official figures show Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important US Markets    including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs    Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons  Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons, said one expert Its an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy Theres a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it, another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer todays reality Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as nebulous, one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 335 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry MFN doesnt really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries It will be difficult to regain access to the US Market because different forces are in play now, said one Western envoy He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the US, Japan and Europe would also hamper Polands efforts to regain entry Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible  In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a moral right to assistance from the US Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally But a Western economist said The argument that US Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy wont cut any ice The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners He stressed that the US had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Polands partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations, he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate  REUTER  ",0

"ROYAL DUTCH SHELL US EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER Royal Dutch Shell Group  RDAS  earnings for 1986 from the US Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year, while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 254 billion stg from 303 billion previously, with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts Shell Transport and Trading Plc  SCL  shares, the UK Arm of the group, rose to 1139 stg from a close last night of 1106 stg Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985 Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986 The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half year lag, analysts said Holmes said that in the upstream US Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period, with Shell Oil being one of them The decrease in US Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes added Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue US Exploration activity Exploration is currently pretty flat We are going to go on, but at 16 18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn, he said A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the US Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel Ultimately this would lead to a rise in US Imports If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything, he noted US Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel This favored OPECs attempts to stabilise prices, as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non OPEC marginal production shutting down OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily well Everything is moving in (its) direction, he added  Reuter  ",0
"BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spains decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist governments determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth I think its a good measure, a senior foreign banker said Its a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy It shows that the political will is very strong They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run, he added The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now    around eight pct for overnight funds    was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive The government says industrys competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation At 83 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spains major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago To help meet this years target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 135 pct, left it unchanged at todays auction The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in todays official gazette Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates  REUTER  ",0

"FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY French official reserves fell 4506 billion francs to 37595 billion at the end of January from 42100 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry said in a statement It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS) Foreign currency reserves fell by 891 billion francs during the month, the ministry said This reflected outflows of 1026 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund, counterbalanced by a gain of 135 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM) But most of the decline reflected a 3390 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short term financing instruments The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the franc On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves to 9883 billion francs at the end of January from 10774 billion at end December Gold reserves were unchanged at 21845 billion francs Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 7325 billion francs from 7527 billion at end December Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln francs to 1931 billion francs  REUTER  ",0

"DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987 Leaks of a major Dutch official economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year, political and market sources say Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2 1 2 pct wage increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth But whatever the governments response, the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson   in an estimate reflecting general sentiment   said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar, Pierson said in its February economic outlook The latest growth forecasts are well below a 15 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 25 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990 Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilders revaluation in line with the West German mark in last Januarys European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment Some analysts also question the central banks decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market, noting the (45 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest rate policies serve that goal Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank The cabinets policy is steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark, he said  REUTER  ",0

"YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER US TRADE A reduction of the US federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nations huge trade deficit, US trade representative Clayton Yeutter said Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said Capital and trade flows are clearly inter releated now Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits Private analysts have said that the financing of large US budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of US Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other US securities as well Well make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but theres still a long way to go, Yeutter said He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on US and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, US competitiveness and the establishment of a level playing field for trade The US trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down On the fiscal side, Yeutter said the budget deficit is still our biggest problem and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit In the international area, he said that our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said Japan is just not doing the job on the import side Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner In a Washington address to an Export Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued The market will determine the dollars proper value in the end, Yeutter said However, he added that, if the US and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the US trade deficit, the dollar will be the equalizer Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers He said theres relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by US trading partners, Yeutter said There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation, Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems  Reuter  ",0

"NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG US, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the yens sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G 5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan US Trade axis into a Japan  European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza, he said On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242 Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G 5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US, against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them Suddenly, instead of the US, It is Europe that is laying the golden egg, said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge, said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry If you want my objective view, I dont expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again, he said  REUTER   ",0

"OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 158 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord, he said I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work, he said Lukman gave no specific figures for February output He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said That could well be correct Opecs news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in February But it gave no figures But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 153 and 155 mln bpd The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd Opec agreed in December to cut output by 725 pct to 158 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1 Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said Lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in February, Nigeria propuced 75 100,000 bpd below its 1238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks We have to be patient for two or three weeks The market is now firming on actual fundamentals, he said, adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early April This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline rich crudes such as Nigerias The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products Also, some of Venezuelas heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said Lukman said that if refiner buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels, they would eventually have to buy Opec oil When they realise it is not a free for all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on, he said Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak He said that so far, no meeting of the seven nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment At this time, we have to get our priorities right, he said The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said  Reuter  ",0

not appear very promising for a country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs But he added: They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the worlds largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations, which others wanted changed, one senior coffee dealer said The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share At the end of the talks, he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the dealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents, he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 229 cents lower Thursday at 10468 cents a lb, while more distant deliveries fell the six cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped up Brazilian marketing efforts They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been, according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential Bache Securities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they cant afford to store the crops, he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than usual, this year in our (US) exports, Loewy said Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA), said this years Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 137 mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the US crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the US government soybean loan rate, offered to farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan Were getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export, Eshleman said But he added it will be a while before US exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage, he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said it would not make a big difference On other commodity markets, Brazils selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 87 sugar harvest, which could limit exports to the world market, analysts said The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will give it little room to stretch exports, they said Brazils other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of surplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell, so I dont think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it, one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would collapse and they cant afford to do that, she added  Reuter  ",0

"US MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY US money supply growth is slowing down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserves main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy     M 1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported today, rose 19 billion dlrs to 7385 billion, but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs The monthly average in January was 7371 billion dlrs M 1 makes up about a quarter of M 2 and a fifth of M 3 With other components of M 2, such as money market deposit accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say M 1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when theyre all sending the same signal This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed, McCarthy said Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, We have some very good looking monetary aggregate data Its coming in a lot weaker than I thought     The economists were quick to caution that one months data prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had been so rapid M 1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 167 pct rate and at a 191 pct rate in the past 13 weeks Moreover, some of the contraction in M 2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago, he noted He expects only five to six pct M 1 growth in March and rises in M 2 and M 3 of about four pct Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M 1 and five pct or less for M 2 and M 3, but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak Youd certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past There was certainly nothing in the Feds latest balance sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under way, economists said Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve Americas most urgent economic problem, its massive trade deficit Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation   and thus rising inflation   may be needed to close the trade gap, Brusca said Im not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market  Reuter  ",0

"CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL US crude oil prices rose above 18  dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers, said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher, he added The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 1815 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 150 dlrs this week The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 1825 dlrs a barrel Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 158 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question, McKinley said Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 13 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 35 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March), the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 147 mln bpd this week Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments This will reduce short haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there, McKinley said International oil traders said that other short haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower because of the Saudi cut (to 31 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas  He added, The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 25 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price, he added There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the US Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 1760 dlrs, far below the official price of 1892 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light Iranian oil is also surfacing in the US Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 1750 dlrs official price There is a lot of oil priced on government to government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold, one international trader said  Reuter  ",0

"BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS Strikes by Brazils 40,000 seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the countrys industrial heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage The seamens leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today entitled Dangerous Confrontation, said: From the economic point of view the seamens strike carries an alarming cost, with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the countrys external trade The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamens strike is legal But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunals ruling Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the governments Cruzado Plan price freeze Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month Not only workers but also businessmen are restive Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 126 cruzados (six US Cents) a litre from 056 cruzados (about 25 cents) Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still could Political sources said the government of President Jose Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel supply situation  Reuter  ",0
"DOME PETE DMP  SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure from one of its largest creditors,  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , to sell its 42 pct stake in  Encor Energy Corp Ltd , energy industry analysts said Dome has pledged its 425 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947 mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to pay down debt, analysts said The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset, said one analyst who asked not to be named Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor Energy, but reaffirmed the companys 233 pct interest in Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd  DM  is up for sale at the right price Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 610 billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said The Encor shares do not pay dividends A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake At current market prices, Domes stake in Encor would be valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 209 mln Dome Mines shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said Encors stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in crude prices, Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years, he added Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 7 1 8, near its 52 week high of 7 1 2 and up from around six dlrs in early February The company also recently set up its own operating management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum, Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented Dome and Encor are actually going to get farther apart So (the sale) does make a lot of sense, Mote said However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Domes debt to Commerce Bank I think theyll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as they can, said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber Some of Domes group of 56 major creditors might move to block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets Other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them, said analyst Gobert Another stumbling block would be Encors 225 mln dlr joint liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of Dome Petroleums interest in Dome Mines Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleums debt and has a right of consent to the sale of Dome Petroleums holding Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares would seek some type of relief on the companys debt obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares, but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share are very attractive  Reuter  ",0

"POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN US DEBT FUTURES Higher oil prices and stronger than expected US employment growth led to sharp losses in US interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said The increase of 319,000 in non farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101 2 32 at the opening Friday, they noted I dont like that fact that we had a close below 101, said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner The 101 2 32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100 10 32 Friday Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101 19 32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses I tend to go along with the double top scenario, said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99 16 32 next week The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiners expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, the inflation outlook is improving, Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday The runup in crude oil will be a short lived phenomenon, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely media induced, Singer said He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, oil stocks are at tremendously high levels Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices  Reuter  ",0
